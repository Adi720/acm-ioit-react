                ACM IOIT Student Chapter was founded on 2019, with a vision to carry forward ACM’s international intentions on a grass root level at AISSMS’ Institute of Information Technology. 
                The motive behind starting this Student Chapter was to instill in everyone an intrigue and passion for learning and innovation in technology. Our Chapter, though only recently established and is one the newer Chapters, aims to expand in quality and quantity, and to be instrumental to every student’s technical growth.
                Our Chapter focuses on enhancing and boosting every student’s technical fervor by frequently organizing various events throughout the year like Technical Competitions, Eminent Speaker Programs, and Discussions with the chapter members. 
                We are currently a family of 100 members and strive to be an efficient platform for students at an undergraduate level for learning new skills and putting those skills to good use.
