When several people have selfish, potentially conflicting, goals but also must cooperate to achieve something, game theory is the natural realm. Instead of people, consider geographically distributed processes sharing resources across the globe, and you see the connection to computing. In the modern era of computing agents acting autonomously and interacting with each other, strategic reasoning and algorithms combine in new ways, posing new challenges and new opportunities. The talk is an invitation to this fascinating emerging area of research."

        descLong : "The GNU Compiler Collection is an optimizing, highly portable compiler created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Its portability and performance have made it the standard reference compiler against which other compilers are compared with today. Industrially, it has enabled organizations - small and large - to reduce their costs of implementation by simply porting the GCC system to their architecture. Academically, the availability of its source has opened up opportunities for teaching and research using a system used in practice to compile almost every open source, as well as other software out there.This talk introduces the essential architecture of the compiler for anyone interested in porting it for commercial as well as academic goals."
